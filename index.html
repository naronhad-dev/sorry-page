    <h1>I'm Sorry</h1>
    <p>
      Adrita ❤️,<br><br>

      I know I messed up, and I’m really sorry 😔💔  
      I stayed quiet when I should’ve explained myself,  
      and that made you feel hurt and doubted me 🥺🙏  
      That was never my intention, and I feel awful for it 😭  

      <br><br>

      You mean so much to me ❤️💖  
      You make normal days brighter and bad days easier 🌙💫  
      I hate that my mistake caused you pain 😞💔  
      I just want you to feel happy and safe always 🫶✨  

      <br><br>

      I don’t expect you to forgive me immediately ⏳  
      I just want you to know this apology comes from my heart 💌💔  
      My feelings for you are real and I truly care about you 🥀💖  

      <br><br>

      Always sorry and always caring 🫶💓<br>

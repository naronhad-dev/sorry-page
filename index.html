    <h1>I'm Sorry</h1>
    <p>
      Adrita ❤️,<br><br>

      I know I messed up so badly 😔💔  
      I stayed quiet when I should’ve explained myself 🥺🙏  
      That made you feel hurt, doubted me, and I feel awful for it 😭  

      <br><br>

      I keep thinking about how I could’ve done better  
      and it hurts that I didn’t act right the first time 💔  
      I wish I could rewind and fix everything,  
      because losing your trust even for a moment feels unbearable 🥀  

      <br><br>

      You mean so much to me ❤️💖  
      You make normal days brighter, bad days easier,  
      and my world better just by existing 🌙💫  
      I never want my actions to make you feel anything less than loved 🫶✨  

      <br><br>

      I’m really, really sorry 🙏  
      I don’t expect forgiveness immediately ⏳  
      I just want you to know this apology is real 💌💔  
      My feelings for you are genuine and I care about you more than words can say 💖  

      <br><br>

      Please know I’ll try to do better every single day 🌸💫  
      You deserve honesty, care, and attention  
      and I promise to never take you for granted again 🥰💓  

      <br><br>

      Always sorry, always caring 🫶💖<br>
      — Dishan 💌
